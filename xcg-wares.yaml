# Chemicals are mostly extracted from impurities in the ice and ore. Chemicals revenue and profits surpass even
# Antimatter Cells, because:
# - The station owner has to mine for 4 resources simultaneously, making production more complicated and restricting
#   efficient station placement.
# - The resource volume is twice that of Antimatter Cells, which means more miners have to be bought to supply a

# - While production volume is only ⅙ of Antimatter Cells (meaning transporting Chemicals should be easier), this

    Hey, there, it's Zon! A few years ago, I was at a point with Ramazon where our growth was STAGNATING. We still had
    a 100% year-over-year growth, of course I'm amazing, but it was a low point from our 140% growth of the previous
    year. I was looking at a Waffly mural spraypainted on the hull parts of an Argon Prime station. In utmost
    concentration, I contemplated vividly, and then it came to me. People want art. People want to be dazzled with
    jewelry! They want to experience the latest hologame on their industry-ready computers. They want space cars! And
    finger lasers, man, those finger lasers! Why hadn't I thought about it before? Ramazon the luxury company! So I set
    out and designed a derivative of my extremely successful and masterfully designed Consumer Goods package. What you
    are looking at is the Luxury Goods package. It's more pricey, of course, but it's not like those habitat workforce
    sheep are strapped for cash. They don't even need to pay rent, hah! So RAM A ZON and get rich! (With this package,
    we charge a 50% profit fee, because I honestly think my AMAZING idea should be worth half of your warehouse profits!
