# Chemicals are mostly extracted from impurities in the ice and ore. Chemicals revenue and profits surpass even
# Antimatter Cells, because:
# - The station owner has to mine for 4 resources simultaneously, making production more complicated and restricting
#   efficient station placement.
# - The resource volume is twice that of Antimatter Cells, which means more miners have to be bought to supply a
#   Chemicals production module.
# - While production volume is only ⅙ of Antimatter Cells (meaning transporting Chemicals should be easier), this
#   advantage does not counteract the increased amount of miners that have to be acquired.
# Because of these points, the blueprint should cost as much as that of Antimatter Cell production, while Chemicals
# are more profitable than Antimatter Cells (1.30 average markup instead of 1.10).
